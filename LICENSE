## 🧭 Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  
By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program —  
to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  

When we speak of free software, we are referring to **freedom, not price**.  
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to:
- Distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish),
- Receive source code or get it if you want it,
- Change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,
- Know that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender them.  
Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:  
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,  
you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
1. Assert copyright on the software.
2. Offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is **no warranty** for this free software.  
For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed,  
so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

## ⚖️ How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public,  
the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program:
